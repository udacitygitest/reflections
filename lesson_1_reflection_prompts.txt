How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Showing the lines that were changed, helped me detect the error.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Having the history with details about new features added every time I changed the files helped me easily remember the changes i made.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Having the commit feature executed manually, I was able to decide which changes needed to be commited.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Since all files are related as a project, it is better to save them all at once, even though some of them have not changed.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

It helps with viewing the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

Eventhough If I break something, I can fix it quickly.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use if for Cassandra and other popular open source projects.
